## Render Project Emulate Markdown

For our project page we want to be able to render markdown.
We know we should render markdown serverside because client side
markdown rendering is difficult to implement and provides inconsistent results.

our `render_projects.py` will render our json with the markdown into html.
Eventually we'll rework this code into our serverless functions.
